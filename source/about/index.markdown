 I am a Java developer, My major skills includes JEE 5/6  stack (Ejb3.1, JPA 2.0, CDI etc). Also I have written couple popular android applications (cricscoredroid). I am also playing roles as configuration Manager, DBA,  new father ( and cricket player :) ).

 This blog will focus on technical help, tools and ideas and solutions to problem which I encounter daily related to programming.

 Currently Iâ€™m learning Apache Hadoop, Python, exploring open source cloud engines.
