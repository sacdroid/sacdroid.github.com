 Today after upgrading eclipse to juno(4.2) and installing subclipse 1.6, I got following error on Ubuntu 12.04 installtion,
{% codeblock %}
Failed to load JavaHL Library.
    These are the errors that were encountered:
    no libsvnjavahl-1 in java.library.path
    no svnjavahl-1 in java.library.path
    no svnjavahl in java.library.path
    java.library.path = /usr/lib/jni:/lib
{% endcodeblock %}


I run into this error every time I upgrade eclipse as subclipse needs javahl library. Usually a fix is to install javahl from ubuntu repo,
{% codeblock %}

sudo apt-get install libsvn-java

{% endcodeblock %}

But this time it did not fix the issue, I got same error after restarting eclipse. 

I found that javahl library location has been changed to `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/jni` on ubuntu 64 (12.04) using find command 

So updated `java.library.path` location in `ECLIPSE_HOM/eclipse.ini` file from
{% codeblock %}
-Djava.library.path=/usr/lib/jni
{% endcodeblock %}

to
{% codeblock %}
-Djava.library.path=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/jni
{% endcodeblock %}

and that did the trick!
