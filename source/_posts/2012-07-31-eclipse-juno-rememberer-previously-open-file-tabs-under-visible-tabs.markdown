If you tried Eclipse Juno, you may see strange behaviour with open tabs in editors. Juno has stopped retaining open file tabs tabs. If you open new file using `Ctrl Shift R`, it closes last active file . This behaviour is started in Juno.

If you take a look in the preferences, in the appearance section, you wonâ€™t find anything related to this.

The good news is that I found fix, rather work around :). Go to Preferences -> General -> Appearance and switch to the Classic theme. Yes, switching theme solved this issue.

I am still looking for correct fix, let me know if you find one.
