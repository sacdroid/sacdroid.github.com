Its been more than half year since I blogged last time. I was busy trying to settle up in my personal life. During this period, I purchased <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/sachin6870/MyNewHome?authkey=Gv1sRgCMeO9L-Q6eT1_wE">new home</a> and also I got married on 23rd nov. So its been eventful period for me. Now I am enjoying my married life.<br />  As 2011 is beginning, I decided to restart my technical blogging. Apart from my personal life, I have tried to continue my technical evolution. Meanwhile I owned a android device, <a href="http://www.htc.com/uk/product/wildfire/overview.html">HTC Wildfire</a> and now I am quite busy with experimenting android apps and custom roms. I will try to post android experiment in coming days.  <br /><br />  Happy New Year 2011.</div>
