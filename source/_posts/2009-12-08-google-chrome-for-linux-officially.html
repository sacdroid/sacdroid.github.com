Till today I was using <a href="http://www.chromium.org/">Chromium</a> custom build to get feel of Google chrome web browser which was primarily released for Windows.  Bit about chromium,<br /><br /><blockquote>Chromium is an open-source browser project that aims to build a safer, faster, and more stable way for all Internet users to experience the web. The Chromium codebase is the basis for Google’s Chrome browser.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />  But Finally Google has released GNU/Linux version <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/w00t.html">Google Chrome</a><br /><br /> Thanks to the many Chromium and WebKit developers who helped make Google Chrome a lean browsing machine. <br />Here are a few fun facts from us on the Google Chrome for Linux team:<br /><br /><ul><br />  <li>60,000 lines of Linux-specific code written</li><br />  <li>2,713 Linux-specific bugs fixed</li><br />  <li>12 external committers and bug editors to the Google Chrome for Linux code base</li><br />  <li>48 external code contributors</li><br /> </ul><br /><br />  Needless to say, I installed it on my laptop and using it now,<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_A2_wLwXdBek/Sx8y984SKLI/AAAAAAAACtc/cJbED91p9jQ/s1600-h/Screenshot-2.png"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 200px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_A2_wLwXdBek/Sx8y984SKLI/AAAAAAAACtc/cJbED91p9jQ/s320/Screenshot-2.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5413101317018233010" /></a><br /><br /> <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/eula.html?platform=linux&hl=en"> Give a try</a>, Ignore beta tag of release. Google’s “beta” products are more mature than the final releases of many other companies.(and that’s sad.)</div>
