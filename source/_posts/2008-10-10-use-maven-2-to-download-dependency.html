There are two ways to download dependency source<br /><br />1)This will generate Eclipse project files with source code attached to eclipse classpath.<br /> >maven eclipse:eclipse -downloadSource=true<br /><br /> if you also want java documentation to be<br />added to your classpath, use,<br /><br />>maven eclipse:eclipse -downloadJavadoc=true.   <br /><br />2)If you are using some other IDE, use following maven target,<br />it will download source jars at local M2 repository.<br /><br />>mvn dependency:sources<br /><br />Maven rocks!!!</div>
