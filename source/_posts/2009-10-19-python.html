<div class='post'>
<div style="text-align: justify;">  I wanted to download few regional (marathi)  videos from youtube. I found a interesting and nicely written python script called<a href="http://bitbucket.org/rg3/youtube-dl/wiki/Home"> youtube-dl</a>.<br />This script is written in object oriented way. This made may to dig out <a href="http://www.python.org/">python</a> more.<br /><br />So I decided during this vacations I will be learning new (object oriented) scripting language, Python.<br /><br />Notes:<br />1) Swap in a statement<br />This question is very common in C, C++technical interviews, In Python, the simultaneous assignment statement offers an elegant alternative. Here is a simpler Python equivalent:<br />x, y = y, x<br />2) Indentations matters<br />Python programming blocks are grouped using indentations.<br /><br />1)<br /><pre name="code" class="Python"><br />for i in range(x):<br />  fact = fact * (x- i)<br />print fact<br /></pre><br />2)<br /><pre name="code" class="Python"><br />for i in range(x):<br /> fact = fact * (x- i)<br /> print fact<br /></pre><br /><br />Above two snippet will generate two difference outputs, In second snippet print statement is part of for loop.<br /><br />3) Range it!!<br /> Python has inbuilt function, Range, which will generate list of numbers.  There are other variations of range that can be used to produce different sequences:,<br /><pre name="code" class="Python"><br />>>> range(10)<br />[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]<br />>>> range(5,10)<br />[5, 6, 7, 8, 9]<br />>>> range(5, 10, 3)<br />[5, 8]<br /><br /></pre><br /><br />4) "Long Int" is really long:<br />   Python has new datatype, long int. A long int is not a fixed size, but expands to accommodate whatever value it holds. The only limit is<br />the amount of memory the computer has available to it.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></div>
