After I moved to United States, I found interesting concept here to sell unused items in your home, called as Garage Sale or Yard sale. The garage sale sell the used thing but it's still good quality. You can buy something with the cheap price over there. You can save much money from buying yard sale.

 But its bit hard to find garage sale which will interesting and near to you, so I decided to use my android development skills to write app to do this which will use current GPS or user entered location to find garage sales and allow search using item names like chairs, books etc. Initial work of android application is complete and its google play now, named as "Garagesaledroid",
