    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
As huge cricket fan, I wanted to have easy access to cricket scores, right at gnome-panel on Ubuntu OS, the way I see date/time. I searched for it on Internet but could not find. So I decided to write my own a gnome-applet which will show latest score at gnome-panel.<br />  I modified this <a href="http://blog.kevinmehall.net/2009/python-gnome-panel-applet">applet</a> to show cricket score. Originally it was meant to show battery power.<br />  Cricket score applet is written in python using <a href="http://www.sachystechnoworld.co.cc/2009/10/python.html">my latest python skills</a> which makes use of <a href="http://livechat.rediff.com/sports/score/score.txt">rediff scores</a> as source.<br /><br />Screenshot: <br /> <br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_A2_wLwXdBek/Sw5brJ3YVUI/AAAAAAAACtM/Cnwf_6WgMYA/s1600/cricscore.jpg"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 84px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_A2_wLwXdBek/Sw5brJ3YVUI/AAAAAAAACtM/Cnwf_6WgMYA/s320/cricscore.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5408360999459247426" /></a><br /><br /><br />This applet can be downloaded from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/cricscoreapplet/">here</a>. It contains install.sh script copies the files to the necessary locations to make it show up in the applets list. You have to restart gnome display manager either by re-logging in or with this command:<br /><pre name="code" class="cpp"><br />sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart<br /></pre><br />  <br />This is my first contribution to wonderful Linux world, hence you might find bugs. Please feel free to contact me @ sachin6870@gmail.com.<br /><br />  Enjoy!!!<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"> [Update]</span>: Few of interesting user requested me to put details step how to install this utility, here you go:<br />  <br />Download cricscore.tar.gz and navigate to that folder and run following commands, (in my case the folder &#8220;~/downloads&#8221;) and run following commands,<br /><br /><pre name="code" class="cpp"><br />sachin@sachin-laptop:~/downloads$ tar xzf cricscore.tar.gz<br />sachin@sachin-laptop:~/downloads$ cd cricscore/<br />sachin@sachin-laptop:~/downloads/cricscore$ ls<br />cricketscore.py cricketscore.server install.sh<br />sachin@sachin-laptop:~/downloads/cricscore$ sudo ./install.sh<br />[sudo] password for sachin:<br /></pre><br /> This step will logout, make sure you save all your work.<br /><pre name="code" class="cpp"><br />sachin@sachin-laptop:~/downloads/cricscore$ sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart<br /></pre><br /> <br /> After re-login, Right click in an empty space on your gnome panel and select Add to Panel from the menu that appears. A small window pops open, which displays the panel applets that are installed. Find &#8220;Cricket Score Applet&#8221; in the list, click Add, and then click Close. A new icon appears on the panel.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">[update]</span>  hosted this utility at <a href="http://cricscoreapplet.sourceforge.net/">sourceforge</a></div>

There is no &quot;best desktop&quot;, but there is a desktop that&#39;s best for you. It&#39;s a matter of preference.<br /><br />I used KDE for a year, specially for Amarok.  But then switched to Gnome http://www.sachystechnoworld.co.cc/2009/10/themes-for-gnome-ubuntu.html.<br /> I feel gnome has much professional look and feel, KDE is good for who has switched from Windows recently.</div>

Are you wondering about what will happen to your email/chat accounts once you die? <br /><br />  Well, I remember if you don&#8217;t use your account for some period of time or so, then provider terminates it, and, in fact, having asked around all the majors - Gmail, Yahoo Mail, Hotmail and Twitter, that does seem to be largely the case. Here&#8217;s how it runs.,<br /><br />Gmail<br /><br />Google will terminate your account in accordance with the terms of service if you fail to login to your account for a period of nine months is the phrase I was looking for along with the fact that people can actively delete their accounts.<br /><br />Yahoo! Mail<br /><br />Yahoo! was also most accommodating. The answer was very different though. It seems, with their service, that once your name has gone, it&#8217;s gone forever. As it stands, inactive accounts are not terminated and will lie idle indefinitely.<br /><br /><br />Twitter<br /><br />Accounts that are inactive for more than 6 months may be removed without further notice.</div>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
After upgrade to Ubuntu Karmic, mouse clicks stopped in <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">eclipse</a>, my favourite IDE, mainly for submit buttons. Until today I used keyboard as alternative, but it was bit frustrating. <br /><br />  This issue raised because karmic brings version 2.18 of GTK+ to the desktop. GTK+ is a multi-platform toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces. Offering a complete set of widgets, the GTK+ is suitable for projects ranging from small one-off tools to complete application suites.<br /><br />Eclipse assume that they can just operate on the X windows corresponding to their GDK windows without ever telling GDK, which causes some widgets to exhibit weird behaviour. <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=287307">Bug 287307</a> was filed with the Eclipse foundation and this is fixed for the upcoming 3.6 release.<br /><br />Fortunately, the GTK+ people provide a switch to turn off the client side windows. So to work around the bug with Eclipse pre-3.6, just make sure you set environment variable GDK_NATIVE_WINDOWS=1  <br /> I created simple eclipse launcher script which will set this variable.<br /><br /><pre name="code" class="cpp"><br />#!/bin/sh<br />export GDK_NATIVE_WINDOWS=1<br />/home/sachin/opt/eclipse3.5/eclipse<br /><br /></pre><br /><br />and added it to /usr/bin.<br /><br />  Happy coding!!!</div>

Y&#8217;day night,I changed the whole look and feel of this blog. Isn&#8217;t it cool?<br /><br /> I managed to add header image following this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUIdl1xC5eA">video</a> and header image is captured somewhere near to GOA by one my team mate during our last trip.<br />  I edited this image to fit to header size size i.e. 1230 px X 250 px by using <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">gimp</a>. Its really powerful tool to manipulate image.<br /><br /> and background colour is changed by applying my html skills. I picked colour from header image using gimp and edited blog html (Dashboard->Layout->Edit HTML) to add this background colour to body, sidebar and header itself.<br /><br /> Finally I managed to give this nice and cool look and feel to my blog.</div>

I installed Virtualbox on Ubuntu karmic but I ran into trouble with the Guest Additions because the download kept timing out. I solved the problem by following the weblink and manually downloading the Guest Additions disk image. I then used ‘CD/DVD mount’ from Virtualbox’s Devices menu to mount the disk image. When I tried the guest additions installation this time it worked (well, actually it worked on the second attempt so was I just lucky?).<br /><br />I earlier extracted the files/folders from the Guest Additions disk image and tried to manually move them to the lib folder where Virtualbox was searching. I was completely fooled by the permissions for this folder that said I was not the owner even though I am the &#8220;sudo&#8221;. Doubtless I’ll find out why as I explore Ubuntu!</div>

To overcome that I wrote script will be run as cron job,<br /><br />Script:<br /><pre name="code" class="cpp"><br />#!/bin/bash<br />#<br />#<br /># Run-level Startup script for Instance<br /># It relies on the information on pmon<br />check_stat=`ps -aef |grep pmon | grep -v grep | wc -l`;<br />oracle_num=`expr $check_stat`<br />if [ $oracle_num -ne 0 ]<br />then<br /> oracle start<br />exit 16<br />fi<br /></pre><br /><br /> added this script as part of linux &#8220;cron&#8221; jobs.<br /><br />Enjoy!!!</div>

During Diwali vacations, I learnt python language by reading &#8220;Python Programming: Introduction to Computer Science&#8221; by      John M.Zelle, Ph.D, Its well written book with some nice examples which tries to explore power of python.<br />So I decided to write some useful programs in python. I found one interesting open source project from Nokia, Py60. through which you can write python programs for your mobile.<br /><br />Nokia has done great job by introducing <a href="http://wiki.opensource.nokia.com/projects/PyS60">py60.</a>  <blockquote>   <span style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;Python for S60 is Nokia&#8217;s port of the </span><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://python.org/" class="external text" title="http://python.org/" rel="nofollow">Python</a><span style="font-style: italic;"> language to the </span><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://s60.com/" class="external text" title="http://s60.com/" rel="nofollow">S60</a> smartphone platform. In addition to the standard features of the Python language, PyS60 provides access to many of the phone&#8217;s uniquely smartphone-y functions, such as camera, contacts, calendar, audio recording and playing, TCP/IP and Bluetooth communications and simple telephony.&#8221;<blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>  You can use emulator or your mobile phone (S60 platform) to run/test python programs. I use my Nokia N70 to run python and so far it&#8217;s great fun! You can write the program in your computer and transfer it to your mobile phone. There is an interactive console in the mobile phone so that you can write your program directly in the mobile phone. There is another blue-tooth based console which I haven&#8217;t tried yet (my bluetooth dongle is not working, I might have reached its data transfer limit :) ).<br /><br />Currently I am working on a project which will be used find cell phone location based on GSM information provided by service provider.<br />This project will leverage scripts provided <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nokia-gsm-location-hacks/">Nokia GSM location hacks</a>, to geocode  phone location.<br />Usabilty of this application will be to find nearest useful utilities based on your location. Imagine your are in unknown city and you run out of money  and you don&#8217;t know where is the nearest ATM, this project might help you.<br />Bye for now, will update you on status of project on next week.<br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote></blockquote></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">  I wanted to download few regional (marathi)  videos from youtube. I found a interesting and nicely written python script called<a href="http://bitbucket.org/rg3/youtube-dl/wiki/Home"> youtube-dl</a>.<br />This script is written in object oriented way. This made may to dig out <a href="http://www.python.org/">python</a> more.<br /><br />So I decided during this vacations I will be learning new (object oriented) scripting language, Python.<br /><br />Notes:<br />1) Swap in a statement<br />This question is very common in C, C++technical interviews, In Python, the simultaneous assignment statement offers an elegant alternative. Here is a simpler Python equivalent:<br />x, y = y, x<br />2) Indentations matters<br />Python programming blocks are grouped using indentations.<br /><br />1)<br /><pre name="code" class="Python"><br />for i in range(x):<br />  fact = fact * (x- i)<br />print fact<br /></pre><br />2)<br /><pre name="code" class="Python"><br />for i in range(x):<br /> fact = fact * (x- i)<br /> print fact<br /></pre><br /><br />Above two snippet will generate two difference outputs, In second snippet print statement is part of for loop.<br /><br />3) Range it!!<br /> Python has inbuilt function, Range, which will generate list of numbers.  There are other variations of range that can be used to produce different sequences:,<br /><pre name="code" class="Python"><br />>>> range(10)<br />[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]<br />>>> range(5,10)<br />[5, 6, 7, 8, 9]<br />>>> range(5, 10, 3)<br />[5, 8]<br /><br /></pre><br /><br />4) &#8220;Long Int&#8221; is really long:<br />   Python has new datatype, long int. A long int is not a fixed size, but expands to accommodate whatever value it holds. The only limit is<br />the amount of memory the computer has available to it.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></div>

I recently switched gnome desktop after using KDE for one year for no special reason. KDE was good experience.<br /> Gnome has very professional look as compared to KDE. KDE is good for people who are comming from windows background.<br /> Currently I am exploring various themes in gnome. Its nice to see you can change your desktop on one click.<br /> I love dark themes. My favourites are,<br />  1) Karmic - x (This is my current theme.)<br />  2) Elegant Brit<br />  3) Mesmerized.<br /><br /> you can explore more dark themes <a href="http://www.catswhocode.com/blog/20-beautiful-dark-themes-for-gnome-and-ubuntu">here</a><br /><br /> I did not like scroll bars in firefox for some of the themes. Its too dark to get hidden with background. Workaround I found is, Just go to the add-on part of their website, and install iFox Metal for your skin.<br /><br />Enjoy<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update[Mon, Oct 19, 2009] : </span><span>Oops, My  favourite music player &#8220;Amarok&#8221; stoped </span><span>working in Gnome. Its known <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/amarok/+bug/371360">issue</a> in Gnome for KDE apps</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">. </span><span>As always</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span>open source communities, this issue also has work around</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> :).  </span><span>Also Gnome has alternative player, <a href="http://www.exaile.org/">Exaile. </a><br />   Exaile looks cool and lightweight at 1st glance.<br /></span></div>

After a big break, Today, <br /><br />I will be presenting collection of Linux related quotes,<br /><br />1) In most countries selling harmful things like drugs is punishable.<br />Then howcome people can sell Microsoft software and go unpunished?

Use Linux<br />(Unknown source)<br /><br />4)  linux: because a PC is a terrible thing to waste(ks @cis.ufl.edu put this on Tshirts in &#8216;93)<br /><br />5) `When you say &#8220;I wrote a program that crashed Windows&#8221;, people just stare at<br />you blankly and say &#8220;Hey, I got those with the system, *for free*&#8221;.&#8217;<br />(By Linus Torvalds).<br /><br />6) &#8220;World domination.

Its been 15 days today since I became completely OPEN SOURCE.  Yes, I dumped windows XP and started using Ubuntu for full time development. These days, I am busy exploring new things in Ubuntu.<br />Believe me, in these days fifteen days, I never missed my old windows XP set up. I got alternative for each application which I use in my daytoday life for FREE of Cost with full support.<br />    Its been fantastic experience so far with Linux world. Today, I am going to share my experience  during my  Open source &#8220;revolution&#8221; phase, :).<ul><li>   As I am Java developer , First thing I looked for  setting up JDK on ubuntu.  Installing JDK was straight forward. I used this link, <a href="http://dambalah.com/2007/09/21/install-java-on-ubuntu/">Install Java on Ubuntu</a>, which is very well organized and clear.<br /></li><li> Eclipse 3.3 is not available in the Ubuntu repository yet (<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/debian/+source/eclipse/+bug/123064">progress</a>), and I need this version because the plugins (JBoss Tools) I&#8217;m using require it.      So you need download eclipse 3.3 froe eclipse.org and unzip it to any directory. The locations I used is /opt/eclipse.<br /><br />Now configuration for /opt/eclipse. Set Up java_home,<br /><br />sudo -b gedit /opt/eclipse/java_home<br /><br />and add<br /><br />/usr/lib/jvm/java-5-sun<br /><br />to the top of the file.<br /><br />You need adjust increase stack and heap sizes for eclipse/JVM to avoid OutOfMemoryError,<br />sudo -b gedit /opt/eclipse/eclipse.ini<br />The argument Xms refers to the minimum heap size and Xmx refers to the maximum heap size.<br /><br />adjust them as your memory size.<br /><p class="line874">create executable:                                                                                         Make a bin folder in your home directory, this will be used for the startup script: <span class="anchor" id="line-189"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-190"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-191"></span></p><pre>$ mkdir ~/bin</pre><span class="anchor" id="line-192"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-193"></span><p class="line862">Next create an executable for Eclipe at <tt>~/bin/eclipse</tt> with your favorite text editor by typing <tt>vi ~/bin/eclipse</tt> or <tt>nano ~/bin/eclipse</tt> into the command line.
