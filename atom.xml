    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During last cricket world cup, I developed cricket score android application named as cricscoredroid. I had taken this application off from android market for 6 months now as there was not free score provider was available after world cup.</p>

<p> Cricscoredroid was very popular during cricket world cup, it had 4.5 rating in android market and was installed by more than 25k users within 2 months of its release. Reason of its popularity was its very simple and fastest in android market. Also it has some unique notification features.</p>

<p> Cricscoredroid is back in Google Play now with lots UI improvements. Cricscoredroid now features Android HOLO dark theme and Honeycomb styled Action Bar using <a href="http://www.holoeverywhere.com/">HoloEverywhere</a>  and <a href="http://actionbarsherlock.com/">ActionBarSherlock</a> . What this library does is that if you’re using your app in a device with Android 2.x, it gives you an ActionBar that is a copy of the real Honeycomb ActionBar, thanks to <a href="http://jakewharton.com/">Jake Wharton</a> , a guy who created this library.</p>

<p> It is available on  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samarth.cricscorereturn">Google Play</a> .
Use and rate it on google play!. Screenshots of cricscoredroid with new Holo Dark theme,</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you tried Eclipse Juno, you may see strange behaviour with open tabs in editors. Juno has stopped retaining open file tabs tabs. If you open new file using <code>Ctrl Shift R</code>, it closes last active file . This behaviour is started in Juno.</p>

<p>If you take a look in the preferences, in the appearance section, you won’t find anything related to this.</p>

<p>The good news is that I found fix, rather work around :). Go to Preferences -> General -> Appearance and switch to the Classic theme. Yes, switching theme solved this issue.</p>

<p>I am still looking for correct fix, let me know if you find one.</p>

    <id>http://sacdroid.github.com/blog/2012/07/26/failed-to-load-javahl-library</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p> Today after upgrading eclipse to juno(4.2) and installing subclipse 1.6, I got following error on Ubuntu 12.04 installtion,</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Failed to load JavaHL Library.
</span><span class='line'>    These are the errors that were encountered:
</span><span class='line'>    no libsvnjavahl-1 in java.library.path
</span><span class='line'>    no svnjavahl-1 in java.library.path
</span><span class='line'>    no svnjavahl in java.library.path
</span><span class='line'>    java.library.path = /usr/lib/jni:/lib</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I run into this error every time I upgrade eclipse as subclipse needs javahl library. Usually a fix is to install javahl from ubuntu repo,</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>sudo apt-get install libsvn-java</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>But this time it did not fix the issue, I got same error after restarting eclipse.</p>

<p>I found that javahl library location has been changed to <code>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/jni</code> on ubuntu 64 (12.04) using find command</p>

<p>So updated <code>java.library.path</code> location in <code>$ECLIPSE_HOME/eclipse.ini</code> file from</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>-Djava.library.path=/usr/lib/jni</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>to</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>-Djava.library.path=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/jni</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>and that did the trick!</p>

    <link href="http://sacdroid.github.com/blog/2012/07/03/gson/"/>
    <updated>2012-07-03T19:54:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://sacdroid.github.com/blog/2012/07/03/gson</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had a problem with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/">Google GSON </a>  deserialization. JSON data which I was trying to parse using GSON library looks like this <code>{"matches":{"matchId":"bla" "score" : "bla"}}</code> and when there is more roles available it looks like this <code>{"matches":[{"matchId":"bla" "score" : "bla"}{"matchId":"hihi" "score" : "hihi"}]}</code>. So sometimes
&#8220;matches&#8221; data comes as &#8220;Object&#8221; or &#8220;ARRAY&#8221; format depending upon number of matches available.</p>

<p>GSON fails as expected to parse this in to Java class which has field of type List class, When JSON data comes with matches as &#8220;Object&#8221; format, it throws exception &#8220;Expected BEGIN_ARRAY but was BEGIN_OBJECT&#8221;.</p>

<p>Source JSON data it self is bogus here, correct fix should be at JSON generator which should always return ARRAY format for array objects irrespective of number of objects being sent.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I don&#8217;t have access to JSON response generator, so I decided to write own GSON&#8217;s TypeAdapter implementation for List type which handles this single instance case, deserializes it and then transform into an List and set it on the field, making it uniform.</p>

<p>Following is implementation of ArrayAdapterFactory,</p>

Its been more than half year since I blogged last time. I was busy trying to settle up in my personal life. During this period, I purchased <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/sachin6870/MyNewHome?authkey=Gv1sRgCMeO9L-Q6eT1_wE">new home</a> and also I got married on 23rd nov. So its been eventful period for me. Now I am enjoying my married life.<br />  As 2011 is beginning, I decided to restart my technical blogging. Apart from my personal life, I have tried to continue my technical evolution. Meanwhile I owned a android device, <a href="http://www.htc.com/uk/product/wildfire/overview.html">HTC Wildfire</a> and now I am quite busy with experimenting android apps and custom roms. I will try to post android experiment in coming days.  <br /><br />  Happy New Year 2011.</div>

After six months of development, Tomorrow, the Ubuntu team will be releasing Final New Version of Ubuntu (10.04) for public. This is Ubuntu Lucid Lynx, a name that combines reflection and vigilance (lucid) the desire to conquer a predator (lynx).<br /> <br /> This release is LTS(Long Term Support),  it means technical support and security updates are provided for a period of at least three years to release &#8220;Desktop&#8221; and at least five years for version &#8220;Server&#8221;.<br /><br /> To download Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Lynx, you can go directly to the official page: ubuntu.com (Available from Thursday, April 29 at 13:00).<br />  Upgrade from an earlier Ubuntu version can be done through a terminal make sure you back up your data.<br /><br /><script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: bash">&lt;![CDATA[<br />sachin@sachin-laptop:~$ update-manager -c -d<br />]]&gt;</script><br /><br />  After upgrade to RC, I experinced something new. Firstly, there is the integration of Plymouth, the system boot graphic that is used in Fedora for quite some time now. Specifically, we are left with only one screen at startup (two cons for version 9.10) and also a boot time much faster.<br />   Canonical wished to develop a whole new identity(Change!!). A new logo (see icon at the top of the article)<br /><br />Music Store:<br />  Canonical seems to always find a profitable business model. With this in mind we now propose to purchase music tracks online, directly from the media player Rhythmbox.<br /><br />Other changes includes,<br /><br />    * Use Linux kernel 2.6.32<br />    * OpenOffice.org goes to version 3.2<br />    * Firefox 3.6<br />    * Gnome 2.30<br />    * KDE 4.4<br /><br />Ubuntu, Change is here!!!<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_A2_wLwXdBek/S9fh-hX4LtI/AAAAAAAAC3Q/x73bzX-U_E0/s1600/ubuntu-10.04-lucid-lynx-plymouth-mini.png"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 187px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_A2_wLwXdBek/S9fh-hX4LtI/AAAAAAAAC3Q/x73bzX-U_E0/s320/ubuntu-10.04-lucid-lynx-plymouth-mini.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5465085137064046290" /></a></div>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
Last week I attended my first <a href="http://gnunify.in">GNUnify</a> Conference in Pune, it is annual event organised by <a href="http://sicsr.ac.in/">SICSR</a> an <a href="http://plug.org.in/">PLUG</a> (Pune Linux User group). It was very good experience, I got chance to listen few open source Geeks around the globe. As it is 2 days event, multiple activities were running in parallel. So missed few &#8220;interesting&#8221; talks although it was organised carefully based on tracks like Software Development, System Administration, Embedded Systems, Embedded Systems.<br /><br /> Being software developer, I decided to attain all possible Software Development related sessions. <br /><br /> So on day first, I started with &#8220;Playing with python&#8221; session by <a href="http://gnunify.in/speaker/profile/85">Kushal Das</a>. Though I have coded few applications in python already, I decided to attain this, as I have never learnt python in any classroom. It was worth, as I learnt few new things about Python which I was not aware of. <br /> <br /> After this workshop, I went for Collaborative Software Development talk by <a href="http://gnunify.in/speaker/profile/23">Senthil Kumaran</a> from CollabNet. It was really useful session for me as I had to deal with various SCM related tasks at my work. Senthil introduced <a href="http://www.redmine.org/">RedMine</a>,a project management web application. It is very flexible and written using Ruby on Rails framework, it is cross-platform and cross-database as well.<br /><br />After this session is over, I walked into another room for &#8220;MySQL Shell Scripting&#8221;, (Good thing of Gnunify is you can just walk in any room at any time). In that session I got idea how I can leverage shell scripting to automate database related daily tasks. <br /><br /> After Lunch break, I went for Embracing the Web Platform talks from Arun Ranganathan. a member of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Advisory Board, and is Chair of the Khronos WebGL Working Group. Arun did more of demonstrated than talk for emerging implementations of HTML5 and other web technologies with tag line <span style="font-style:italic;">&#8220;Pictures speak more than words&#8221;</span> for which audience applauded. After this session, Web.Next talk from <a href="http://gnunify.in/speaker/profile/59">Ragavan Srinivasan</a> gave introuction to &#8220;Weave - a framework for building personalized web experiences&#8221; and Project Jetpack - reimagining Firefox extensions.<br /><br /> I ended my day 1  of GNUnify with &#8220;Next generation Wireless&#8221; which gave how me idea about Wireless networking works, I have very less knowledge about networking itself. So it was worth!!<br /><br /><br />I will write about my day 2 session soon. I gotta go now.<br /> <br />I love freedom (saw this one-liner on Few TEEs at GNUnify)</div>

Recently MS <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8460819.stm">admitted</a> flaws in IE which allows Remote code execution, it allowed recent attacks on Google&#8217;s systems that originated in China. Look at How MS struggling to update its aged Internet Explorer web browser which is very unfortunate.<br /> Lets try to understand what&#8217;s Open Source,<br /><br /> <blockquote><span style="font-style:italic;">Open Source means that the source code of the software may be copied and distributed freely according to the license it is released under.</span></blockquote><br /><br />Open Source software guarantees quality and continuity for the user, because:<br /><br />    * users are no longer dependent on the survival of the software supplier,<br />    * users can continue to develop and change the core of the acquired software,<br />    * users can benefit from successful developments by others who have (previously) used this software,<br />    * rapid bug fixing and feature development  with large community base across globe.<br /><br />The best-known open source software products are the Linux operating system, Mozilla Firefox, the Apache web server and OpenOffice.<br />  Open-sourcing products is the only way that Microsoft can move forward. Look at how many years it took for Microsoft to develop Vista, and how bad it was (Win7 is basically a repaired version of Vista). Look at it struggling to update its Windows Mobile phone OS, which now seems to be an impossible task.<br />  Microsoft will eventually have to start using open-source licenses, to which Steve Ballmer once said &#8220;a cancer&#8221;!!!<br /><br />  Be community driven rather than commercial driven!!!</div>

    <id>http://sacdroid.github.com/blog/2010/01/15/install-subversion-15-on-ubuntu-karmic</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Ubuntu Karmic includes 1.6.x version of Subversion but our source control server is not upgraded to 1.6. Its still in 1.5 version. Don&#8217;t ask me why I am interested in older versions of things, Mainly I work with remote team and SVN server is also hosted remotely hence I&#8217;m forced to consider downgrading my version of subversion so that my local working copy wont get corrupted.<br /><br />First remove 1.6 version of svn from karmic installation,

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>sachin@sachin-laptop:~/Utility/utilscript$ svn --version
</span><span class='line'>svn, version 1.6.5 (r38866)
</span><span class='line'>sachin@sachin-laptop:~$ sudo apt-get remove subversion</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

Ubuntu Januty contains Subversion 1.5 in security packages, hence add jaunt package entry to your /etc/apt/sources.list,
<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jaunty-security main</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

Check if apt-get can see 1.5 version of subversion,
<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>sachin@sachin-laptop:~$ sudo apt-cache showpkg subversion
</span><span class='line'>Package: subversion
</span><span class='line'>Versions:

</span><span class='line'>MD5: 15da1bb51fb2e9ea5e25b3a489b864d9</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

Quick look at man pages of apt-get showed me how to specifiy revision using &#8220;=&#8221;, When I  first time tried to install 1.5.4dfsg1-1ubuntu2.1, it failed,
<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>sachin@sachin-laptop:~$ sudo apt-get install subversion=1.5.4dfsg1-1ubuntu2.1
</span><span class='line'>Reading package lists... Done
</span><span class='line'>Building dependency tree
</span><span class='line'>Reading state information... Done
</span><span class='line'>Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
</span><span class='line'>distribution that some required packages have not yet been created or been moved out of Incoming.

So you need to older version of libsvn1 to comply with subversion version,
<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>sachin@sachin-laptop:~$ sudo apt-get install libsvn1=1.5.4dfsg1-1ubuntu2.1</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
and now subversion,
sachin@sachin-laptop:~$ sudo apt-get install subversion=1.5.4dfsg1-1ubuntu2.1
here you go, check svn version,
<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>sachin@sachin-laptop:~$ svn --version
</span><span class='line'>version 1.5.4 (r33841)
</span><span class='line'>compiled Aug  7 2009, 01:44:11</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

Happy coding&#8230;

Last sunday I got mail from Google Wave team saying,<br /><br /> <span style="font-style:italic;">&#8220;Recently, you applied for a Google Wave developer sandbox account.  Your<br />sandbox account is now ready.&#8221;</span><br /><br />and my long wait for Google Wave invitation ended. I received my google wave and sandbox invitation same time.<br /><br />So What is Google Wave?<br /> <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_A2_wLwXdBek/S0TbkYUGgVI/AAAAAAAACvE/9RKEOk-9oms/s1600-h/wave_icon.png"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 162px; height: 162px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_A2_wLwXdBek/S0TbkYUGgVI/AAAAAAAACvE/9RKEOk-9oms/s320/wave_icon.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5423701269309456722" /></a><br /> <blockquote>Google Wave is an online communication and collaboration tool that makes real-time interactions more seamless &#8211; in one place, you can communicate and collaborate using richly formatted text, photos, videos, maps, and more.</blockquote><br />  The whole idea started with the fact that Email as an invention is around 40 years old and primarily its form hasn’t changed. Engineers at Google thought, what would happen if email was invented today and that formed the basis of Google Wave.<br /><br />With out wasting much time, I started exploring Google Wave features.  As expected it is full of cool features. <br /> One of the key features of Wave is its extensibility. For example, you can create robots, which can participate in waves just like humans do (that is once they are invited in) and reply to your requests like genie.<br /> I decided to write a robot which will give cricket score updates in google wave upon request.<br />I resused python code from <a href="http://cricscoreapplet.sourceforge.net/">gnome Cricket score applet</a> and wrote goole wave robot in python by following <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/wave/extensions/robots/python-tutorial.html">this tutorial.</a><br /><br /> In no time I am ready with my first Google wave robot, cricscorewave@appspot.com,<br /><br />Screen shot 1: ,<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_A2_wLwXdBek/S0TjxkFdO0I/AAAAAAAACvc/zmOiURFT5MM/s1600-h/cricscorewave.jpg"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 319px; height: 320px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_A2_wLwXdBek/S0TjxkFdO0I/AAAAAAAACvc/zmOiURFT5MM/s320/cricscorewave.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5423710291900578626" /></a><br /><br />Screen shot 2:<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_A2_wLwXdBek/S0Tj_7lpV0I/AAAAAAAACvk/qDDlYjIRrTI/s1600-h/Screenshot-2.png"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 310px; height: 320px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_A2_wLwXdBek/S0Tj_7lpV0I/AAAAAAAACvk/qDDlYjIRrTI/s320/Screenshot-2.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5423710538727774018" /></a><br /><br />got Google wave account? give a try,<br /><br /> * <b>How to add criscorewave robot to Google Wave? </b><br />   Add   criscorewave@appspot.com.as a contact in your Contact.

I got this idea from <a href="http://www.itpro.co.uk/618784/google-counting-down-the-seconds-till-the-new-year">goggle new year seconds counter</a>, I decided to set my pidgin status to showing seconds are left in the decade.<br /> After bit of goggling found a command-line program called purple-remote that allows me to automatically update the Pidgin status and message lines.

Its been just three months, I learnt <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> (or I started learning it as there many more aspects to learn) and  I am already very fond of it. Especially I have started using python for scripting work. I automated few things using python scripts which I had to do regularly like a creating users in oracle, copying / importing oracle dumps, syncing Wiki svn log with svn sever and many more. <br />  Some might argue that you can do the same thing in shell scripts or other programming languages. You can do that  but coding in python is 5-10 times faster and <a href="http://pythonconquerstheuniverse.wordpress.com/category/java-and-python/">this article</a> gives insight comparative of Java with python.<br />  To create connection in Java, it involves three steps but with python its just one step<br /><pre name="code" class="py"><br />    conn = cx_Oracle.connect(username, password, sid)<br /></pre><br />  <br />  I am not bad-mouthing Java here. With <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/">JEE6</a> at doorstep, Java has progressed very well as web technologies. <br />  For now, I will be using python for writing utility scripts unless I get chance to work on real big python Project.<br />  As experienced Java programmers, I found this <a href="http://python.computersci.org/">e-book</a> very helpful for learning python <br />  Coding in python as easy as in Java, I have already written <a href="http://cricscoreapplet.sourceforge.net/">cricket live score</a> gnome applet in python which been huge success.<br /><br /> Being interpreted language Python is little bit slow. With the Java just-in-time compiler, Java is faster.</div>

In fact in its just 2nd day after 1.0-alpha release of <a href="http://cricscoreapplet.sourceforge.net/">CricScore Gnome applet</a>, It has netted more than 100 downloads. Now this is a terrific figure by all means since I wrote this as utility for personal use as fun, I was not expecting it could be a professional gnome applet.<br />  I just shared this across few Linux related forums on orkut, ubuntu communities and got such huge reply. It feel good factor to me.<br />There has been very positive reply so far like this,<br /><br /> <blockquote>&#8220;Great applet! I&#8217;ve been looking for something like this. Just what I needed!&#8221;, says Jorgo <br />  upengan78 is running it on &#8220;gentoo&#8221;, he comments, &#8220;It is working as intended. Many thanks for such a nice applet. Good luck for more such applets&#8221;<br />  Ankur suggested me to make it official package, &#8220;Cann&#8217;t we have your applet from official repositories ???&#8221;<br />  Kamalakar says &#8220;I am using it today for India Sri Lanka score. Good to have it on Gnome top panel.&#8221;   <br />   </blockquote><br />There has been few feature requests also and few wanted to have one smiler applet for Football/Socker. I have already implemented few features in latest 1.0 release.  <br />  There are few people interested to work with me in writing an applet for Football, hopefully I will have it defiantly before FIFA2010. <br /><blockquote> Arun S.A.G wants to package this applet for Fedora, &#8220;I would like to package your applet for Fedora, i have tested it in Fedora 12 it works fine :-)&#8221;.</blockquote><br />  Thanks guys for such motivation and feedbacks.  <br /> Today I released <a href="http://cricscoreapplet.sourceforge.net/">1.0 release</a>, I did not do any code changes, as it did not require, alpha release worked like charm, but I added READEME, INSTALL, COPYRIGHT file as this applet is no more personal :).<br /><br />  There are many feature requests pending on my plate. I will try to work on those in spare time.<br /><br />   Possibilities Are Endless!!!</div>

As huge cricket fan, I wanted to have easy access to cricket scores, right at gnome-panel on Ubuntu OS, the way I see date/time. I searched for it on Internet but could not find. So I decided to write my own a gnome-applet which will show latest score at gnome-panel.<br />  I modified this <a href="http://blog.kevinmehall.net/2009/python-gnome-panel-applet">applet</a> to show cricket score. Originally it was meant to show battery power.<br />  Cricket score applet is written in python using <a href="http://www.sachystechnoworld.co.cc/2009/10/python.html">my latest python skills</a> which makes use of <a href="http://livechat.rediff.com/sports/score/score.txt">rediff scores</a> as source.<br /><br />Screenshot: <br /> <br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_A2_wLwXdBek/Sw5brJ3YVUI/AAAAAAAACtM/Cnwf_6WgMYA/s1600/cricscore.jpg"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 84px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_A2_wLwXdBek/Sw5brJ3YVUI/AAAAAAAACtM/Cnwf_6WgMYA/s320/cricscore.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5408360999459247426" /></a><br /><br /><br />This applet can be downloaded from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/cricscoreapplet/">here</a>. It contains install.sh script copies the files to the necessary locations to make it show up in the applets list. You have to restart gnome display manager either by re-logging in or with this command:<br /><pre name="code" class="cpp"><br />sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart<br /></pre><br />  <br />This is my first contribution to wonderful Linux world, hence you might find bugs. Please feel free to contact me @ sachin6870@gmail.com.<br /><br />  Enjoy!!!<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"> [Update]</span>: Few of interesting user requested me to put details step how to install this utility, here you go:<br />  <br />Download cricscore.tar.gz and navigate to that folder and run following commands, (in my case the folder &#8220;~/downloads&#8221;) and run following commands,<br /><br /><pre name="code" class="cpp"><br />sachin@sachin-laptop:~/downloads$ tar xzf cricscore.tar.gz<br />sachin@sachin-laptop:~/downloads$ cd cricscore/<br />sachin@sachin-laptop:~/downloads/cricscore$ ls<br />cricketscore.py cricketscore.server install.sh<br />sachin@sachin-laptop:~/downloads/cricscore$ sudo ./install.sh<br />[sudo] password for sachin:<br /></pre><br /> This step will logout, make sure you save all your work.<br /><pre name="code" class="cpp"><br />sachin@sachin-laptop:~/downloads/cricscore$ sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart<br /></pre><br /> <br /> After re-login, Right click in an empty space on your gnome panel and select Add to Panel from the menu that appears. A small window pops open, which displays the panel applets that are installed. Find &#8220;Cricket Score Applet&#8221; in the list, click Add, and then click Close. A new icon appears on the panel.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">[update]</span>  hosted this utility at <a href="http://cricscoreapplet.sourceforge.net/">sourceforge</a></div>

There is no &quot;best desktop&quot;, but there is a desktop that&#39;s best for you. It&#39;s a matter of preference.<br /><br />I used KDE for a year, specially for Amarok.  But then switched to Gnome http://www.sachystechnoworld.co.cc/2009/10/themes-for-gnome-ubuntu.html.<br /> I feel gnome has much professional look and feel, KDE is good for who has switched from Windows recently.</div>

Are you wondering about what will happen to your email/chat accounts once you die? <br /><br />  Well, I remember if you don&#8217;t use your account for some period of time or so, then provider terminates it, and, in fact, having asked around all the majors - Gmail, Yahoo Mail, Hotmail and Twitter, that does seem to be largely the case. Here&#8217;s how it runs.,<br /><br />Gmail<br /><br />Google will terminate your account in accordance with the terms of service if you fail to login to your account for a period of nine months is the phrase I was looking for along with the fact that people can actively delete their accounts.<br /><br />Yahoo! Mail<br /><br />Yahoo! was also most accommodating. The answer was very different though. It seems, with their service, that once your name has gone, it&#8217;s gone forever. As it stands, inactive accounts are not terminated and will lie idle indefinitely.<br /><br /><br />Twitter<br /><br />Accounts that are inactive for more than 6 months may be removed without further notice.</div>
