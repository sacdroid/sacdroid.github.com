I installed Virtualbox on Ubuntu karmic but I ran into trouble with the Guest Additions because the download kept timing out. I solved the problem by following the weblink and manually downloading the Guest Additions disk image. I then used ‘CD/DVD mount’ from Virtualbox’s Devices menu to mount the disk image. When I tried the guest additions installation this time it worked (well, actually it worked on the second attempt so was I just lucky?).<br /><br />I earlier extracted the files/folders from the Guest Additions disk image and tried to manually move them to the lib folder where Virtualbox was searching. I was completely fooled by the permissions for this folder that said I was not the owner even though I am the "sudo". Doubtless I’ll find out why as I explore Ubuntu!</div>
