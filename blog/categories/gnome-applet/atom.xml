In fact in its just 2nd day after 1.0-alpha release of <a href="http://cricscoreapplet.sourceforge.net/">CricScore Gnome applet</a>, It has netted more than 100 downloads. Now this is a terrific figure by all means since I wrote this as utility for personal use as fun, I was not expecting it could be a professional gnome applet.<br />  I just shared this across few Linux related forums on orkut, ubuntu communities and got such huge reply. It feel good factor to me.<br />There has been very positive reply so far like this,<br /><br /> <blockquote>"Great applet! I've been looking for something like this. Just what I needed!", says Jorgo <br />  upengan78 is running it on "gentoo", he comments, "It is working as intended. Many thanks for such a nice applet. Good luck for more such applets"<br />  Ankur suggested me to make it official package, "Cann't we have your applet from official repositories ???"<br />  Kamalakar says "I am using it today for India Sri Lanka score. Good to have it on Gnome top panel."   <br />   </blockquote><br />There has been few feature requests also and few wanted to have one smiler applet for Football/Socker. I have already implemented few features in latest 1.0 release.  <br />  There are few people interested to work with me in writing an applet for Football, hopefully I will have it defiantly before FIFA2010. <br /><blockquote> Arun S.A.G wants to package this applet for Fedora, "I would like to package your applet for Fedora, i have tested it in Fedora 12 it works fine :-)".</blockquote><br />  Thanks guys for such motivation and feedbacks.  <br /> Today I released <a href="http://cricscoreapplet.sourceforge.net/">1.0 release</a>, I did not do any code changes, as it did not require, alpha release worked like charm, but I added READEME, INSTALL, COPYRIGHT file as this applet is no more personal :).<br /><br />  There are many feature requests pending on my plate. I will try to work on those in spare time.<br /><br />   Possibilities Are Endless!!!</div>

As huge cricket fan, I wanted to have easy access to cricket scores, right at gnome-panel on Ubuntu OS, the way I see date/time. I searched for it on Internet but could not find. So I decided to write my own a gnome-applet which will show latest score at gnome-panel.<br />  I modified this <a href="http://blog.kevinmehall.net/2009/python-gnome-panel-applet">applet</a> to show cricket score. Originally it was meant to show battery power.<br />  Cricket score applet is written in python using <a href="http://www.sachystechnoworld.co.cc/2009/10/python.html">my latest python skills</a> which makes use of <a href="http://livechat.rediff.com/sports/score/score.txt">rediff scores</a> as source.<br /><br />Screenshot: <br /> <br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_A2_wLwXdBek/Sw5brJ3YVUI/AAAAAAAACtM/Cnwf_6WgMYA/s1600/cricscore.jpg"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 84px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_A2_wLwXdBek/Sw5brJ3YVUI/AAAAAAAACtM/Cnwf_6WgMYA/s320/cricscore.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5408360999459247426" /></a><br /><br /><br />This applet can be downloaded from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/cricscoreapplet/">here</a>. It contains install.sh script copies the files to the necessary locations to make it show up in the applets list. You have to restart gnome display manager either by re-logging in or with this command:<br /><pre name="code" class="cpp"><br />sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart<br /></pre><br />  <br />This is my first contribution to wonderful Linux world, hence you might find bugs. Please feel free to contact me @ sachin6870@gmail.com.<br /><br />  Enjoy!!!<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"> [Update]</span>: Few of interesting user requested me to put details step how to install this utility, here you go:<br />  <br />Download cricscore.tar.gz and navigate to that folder and run following commands, (in my case the folder "~/downloads") and run following commands,<br /><br /><pre name="code" class="cpp"><br />sachin@sachin-laptop:~/downloads$ tar xzf cricscore.tar.gz<br />sachin@sachin-laptop:~/downloads$ cd cricscore/<br />sachin@sachin-laptop:~/downloads/cricscore$ ls<br />cricketscore.py cricketscore.server install.sh<br />sachin@sachin-laptop:~/downloads/cricscore$ sudo ./install.sh<br />[sudo] password for sachin:<br /></pre><br /> This step will logout, make sure you save all your work.<br /><pre name="code" class="cpp"><br />sachin@sachin-laptop:~/downloads/cricscore$ sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart<br /></pre><br /> <br /> After re-login, Right click in an empty space on your gnome panel and select Add to Panel from the menu that appears. A small window pops open, which displays the panel applets that are installed. Find "Cricket Score Applet" in the list, click Add, and then click Close. A new icon appears on the panel.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">[update]</span>  hosted this utility at <a href="http://cricscoreapplet.sourceforge.net/">sourceforge</a></div>

There is no &quot;best desktop&quot;, but there is a desktop that&#39;s best for you. It&#39;s a matter of preference.<br /><br />I used KDE for a year, specially for Amarok.  But then switched to Gnome http://www.sachystechnoworld.co.cc/2009/10/themes-for-gnome-ubuntu.html.<br /> I feel gnome has much professional look and feel, KDE is good for who has switched from Windows recently.</div>
