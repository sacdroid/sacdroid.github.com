    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you tried Eclipse Juno, you may see strange behaviour with open tabs in editors. Juno has stopped retaining open file tabs tabs. If you open new file using <code>Ctrl Shift R</code>, it closes last active file . This behaviour is started in Juno.</p>

<p>If you take a look in the preferences, in the appearance section, you wonâ€™t find anything related to this.</p>

<p>The good news is that I found fix, rather work around :). Go to Preferences -> General -> Appearance and switch to the Classic theme. Yes, switching theme solved this issue.</p>

<p>I am still looking for correct fix, let me know if you find one.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
After upgrade to Ubuntu Karmic, mouse clicks stopped in <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">eclipse</a>, my favourite IDE, mainly for submit buttons. Until today I used keyboard as alternative, but it was bit frustrating. <br /><br />  This issue raised because karmic brings version 2.18 of GTK+ to the desktop. GTK+ is a multi-platform toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces. Offering a complete set of widgets, the GTK+ is suitable for projects ranging from small one-off tools to complete application suites.<br /><br />Eclipse assume that they can just operate on the X windows corresponding to their GDK windows without ever telling GDK, which causes some widgets to exhibit weird behaviour. <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=287307">Bug 287307</a> was filed with the Eclipse foundation and this is fixed for the upcoming 3.6 release.<br /><br />Fortunately, the GTK+ people provide a switch to turn off the client side windows. So to work around the bug with Eclipse pre-3.6, just make sure you set environment variable GDK_NATIVE_WINDOWS=1  <br /> I created simple eclipse launcher script which will set this variable.<br /><br /><pre name="code" class="cpp"><br />#!/bin/sh<br />export GDK_NATIVE_WINDOWS=1<br />/home/sachin/opt/eclipse3.5/eclipse<br /><br /></pre><br /><br />and added it to /usr/bin.<br /><br />  Happy coding!!!</div>
