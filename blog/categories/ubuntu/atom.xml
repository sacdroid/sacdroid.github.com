As huge cricket fan, I wanted to have easy access to cricket scores, right at gnome-panel on Ubuntu OS, the way I see date/time. I searched for it on Internet but could not find. So I decided to write my own a gnome-applet which will show latest score at gnome-panel.<br />  I modified this <a href="http://blog.kevinmehall.net/2009/python-gnome-panel-applet">applet</a> to show cricket score. Originally it was meant to show battery power.<br />  Cricket score applet is written in python using <a href="http://www.sachystechnoworld.co.cc/2009/10/python.html">my latest python skills</a> which makes use of <a href="http://livechat.rediff.com/sports/score/score.txt">rediff scores</a> as source.<br /><br />Screenshot: <br /> <br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_A2_wLwXdBek/Sw5brJ3YVUI/AAAAAAAACtM/Cnwf_6WgMYA/s1600/cricscore.jpg"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 84px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_A2_wLwXdBek/Sw5brJ3YVUI/AAAAAAAACtM/Cnwf_6WgMYA/s320/cricscore.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5408360999459247426" /></a><br /><br /><br />This applet can be downloaded from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/cricscoreapplet/">here</a>. It contains install.sh script copies the files to the necessary locations to make it show up in the applets list. You have to restart gnome display manager either by re-logging in or with this command:<br /><pre name="code" class="cpp"><br />sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart<br /></pre><br />  <br />This is my first contribution to wonderful Linux world, hence you might find bugs. Please feel free to contact me @ sachin6870@gmail.com.<br /><br />  Enjoy!!!<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"> [Update]</span>: Few of interesting user requested me to put details step how to install this utility, here you go:<br />  <br />Download cricscore.tar.gz and navigate to that folder and run following commands, (in my case the folder "~/downloads") and run following commands,<br /><br /><pre name="code" class="cpp"><br />sachin@sachin-laptop:~/downloads$ tar xzf cricscore.tar.gz<br />sachin@sachin-laptop:~/downloads$ cd cricscore/<br />sachin@sachin-laptop:~/downloads/cricscore$ ls<br />cricketscore.py cricketscore.server install.sh<br />sachin@sachin-laptop:~/downloads/cricscore$ sudo ./install.sh<br />[sudo] password for sachin:<br /></pre><br /> This step will logout, make sure you save all your work.<br /><pre name="code" class="cpp"><br />sachin@sachin-laptop:~/downloads/cricscore$ sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart<br /></pre><br /> <br /> After re-login, Right click in an empty space on your gnome panel and select Add to Panel from the menu that appears. A small window pops open, which displays the panel applets that are installed. Find "Cricket Score Applet" in the list, click Add, and then click Close. A new icon appears on the panel.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">[update]</span>  hosted this utility at <a href="http://cricscoreapplet.sourceforge.net/">sourceforge</a></div>

There is no &quot;best desktop&quot;, but there is a desktop that&#39;s best for you. It&#39;s a matter of preference.<br /><br />I used KDE for a year, specially for Amarok.  But then switched to Gnome http://www.sachystechnoworld.co.cc/2009/10/themes-for-gnome-ubuntu.html.<br /> I feel gnome has much professional look and feel, KDE is good for who has switched from Windows recently.</div>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
After upgrade to Ubuntu Karmic, mouse clicks stopped in <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">eclipse</a>, my favourite IDE, mainly for submit buttons. Until today I used keyboard as alternative, but it was bit frustrating. <br /><br />  This issue raised because karmic brings version 2.18 of GTK+ to the desktop. GTK+ is a multi-platform toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces. Offering a complete set of widgets, the GTK+ is suitable for projects ranging from small one-off tools to complete application suites.<br /><br />Eclipse assume that they can just operate on the X windows corresponding to their GDK windows without ever telling GDK, which causes some widgets to exhibit weird behaviour. <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=287307">Bug 287307</a> was filed with the Eclipse foundation and this is fixed for the upcoming 3.6 release.<br /><br />Fortunately, the GTK+ people provide a switch to turn off the client side windows. So to work around the bug with Eclipse pre-3.6, just make sure you set environment variable GDK_NATIVE_WINDOWS=1  <br /> I created simple eclipse launcher script which will set this variable.<br /><br /><pre name="code" class="cpp"><br />#!/bin/sh<br />export GDK_NATIVE_WINDOWS=1<br />/home/sachin/opt/eclipse3.5/eclipse<br /><br /></pre><br /><br />and added it to /usr/bin.<br /><br />  Happy coding!!!</div>

Its been 15 days today since I became completely OPEN SOURCE.  Yes, I dumped windows XP and started using Ubuntu for full time development. These days, I am busy exploring new things in Ubuntu.<br />Believe me, in these days fifteen days, I never missed my old windows XP set up. I got alternative for each application which I use in my daytoday life for FREE of Cost with full support.<br />    Its been fantastic experience so far with Linux world. Today, I am going to share my experience  during my  Open source "revolution" phase, :).<ul><li>   As I am Java developer , First thing I looked for  setting up JDK on ubuntu.  Installing JDK was straight forward. I used this link, <a href="http://dambalah.com/2007/09/21/install-java-on-ubuntu/">Install Java on Ubuntu</a>, which is very well organized and clear.<br /></li><li> Eclipse 3.3 is not available in the Ubuntu repository yet (<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/debian/+source/eclipse/+bug/123064">progress</a>), and I need this version because the plugins (JBoss Tools) I'm using require it.      So you need download eclipse 3.3 froe eclipse.org and unzip it to any directory. The locations I used is /opt/eclipse.<br /><br />Now configuration for /opt/eclipse. Set Up java_home,<br /><br />sudo -b gedit /opt/eclipse/java_home<br /><br />and add<br /><br />/usr/lib/jvm/java-5-sun<br /><br />to the top of the file.<br /><br />You need adjust increase stack and heap sizes for eclipse/JVM to avoid OutOfMemoryError,<br />sudo -b gedit /opt/eclipse/eclipse.ini<br />The argument Xms refers to the minimum heap size and Xmx refers to the maximum heap size.<br /><br />adjust them as your memory size.<br /><p class="line874">create executable:                                                                                         Make a bin folder in your home directory, this will be used for the startup script: <span class="anchor" id="line-189"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-190"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-191"></span></p><pre>$ mkdir ~/bin</pre><span class="anchor" id="line-192"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-193"></span><p class="line862">Next create an executable for Eclipe at <tt>~/bin/eclipse</tt> with your favorite text editor by typing <tt>vi ~/bin/eclipse</tt> or <tt>nano ~/bin/eclipse</tt> into the command line. Add the following content: <span class="anchor" id="line-194"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-195"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-196"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-197"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-198"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-199"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-200"></span></p><pre>export MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME="/usr/lib/mozilla/"<br />export ECLIPSE_HOME="$HOME/opt/eclipse"<br /><br />$ECLIPSE_HOME/eclipse $*</pre><span class="anchor" id="line-201"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-202"></span><p class="line874">Finally, allow the script to be executed: <span class="anchor" id="line-203"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-204"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-205"></span></p><pre>$ chmod +x ~/bin/eclipse</pre></li><li>To be continued<br /></li></ul></div>
