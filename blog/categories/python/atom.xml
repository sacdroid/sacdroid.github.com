As huge cricket fan, I wanted to have easy access to cricket scores, right at gnome-panel on Ubuntu OS, the way I see date/time. I searched for it on Internet but could not find. So I decided to write my own a gnome-applet which will show latest score at gnome-panel.<br />  I modified this <a href="http://blog.kevinmehall.net/2009/python-gnome-panel-applet">applet</a> to show cricket score. Originally it was meant to show battery power.<br />  Cricket score applet is written in python using <a href="http://www.sachystechnoworld.co.cc/2009/10/python.html">my latest python skills</a> which makes use of <a href="http://livechat.rediff.com/sports/score/score.txt">rediff scores</a> as source.<br /><br />Screenshot: <br /> <br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_A2_wLwXdBek/Sw5brJ3YVUI/AAAAAAAACtM/Cnwf_6WgMYA/s1600/cricscore.jpg"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 84px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_A2_wLwXdBek/Sw5brJ3YVUI/AAAAAAAACtM/Cnwf_6WgMYA/s320/cricscore.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5408360999459247426" /></a><br /><br /><br />This applet can be downloaded from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/cricscoreapplet/">here</a>. It contains install.sh script copies the files to the necessary locations to make it show up in the applets list. You have to restart gnome display manager either by re-logging in or with this command:<br /><pre name="code" class="cpp"><br />sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart<br /></pre><br />  <br />This is my first contribution to wonderful Linux world, hence you might find bugs. Please feel free to contact me @ sachin6870@gmail.com.<br /><br />  Enjoy!!!<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"> [Update]</span>: Few of interesting user requested me to put details step how to install this utility, here you go:<br />  <br />Download cricscore.tar.gz and navigate to that folder and run following commands, (in my case the folder "~/downloads") and run following commands,<br /><br /><pre name="code" class="cpp"><br />sachin@sachin-laptop:~/downloads$ tar xzf cricscore.tar.gz<br />sachin@sachin-laptop:~/downloads$ cd cricscore/<br />sachin@sachin-laptop:~/downloads/cricscore$ ls<br />cricketscore.py cricketscore.server install.sh<br />sachin@sachin-laptop:~/downloads/cricscore$ sudo ./install.sh<br />[sudo] password for sachin:<br /></pre><br /> This step will logout, make sure you save all your work.<br /><pre name="code" class="cpp"><br />sachin@sachin-laptop:~/downloads/cricscore$ sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart<br /></pre><br /> <br /> After re-login, Right click in an empty space on your gnome panel and select Add to Panel from the menu that appears. A small window pops open, which displays the panel applets that are installed. Find "Cricket Score Applet" in the list, click Add, and then click Close. A new icon appears on the panel.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">[update]</span>  hosted this utility at <a href="http://cricscoreapplet.sourceforge.net/">sourceforge</a></div>

There is no &quot;best desktop&quot;, but there is a desktop that&#39;s best for you. It&#39;s a matter of preference.<br /><br />I used KDE for a year, specially for Amarok.  But then switched to Gnome http://www.sachystechnoworld.co.cc/2009/10/themes-for-gnome-ubuntu.html.<br /> I feel gnome has much professional look and feel, KDE is good for who has switched from Windows recently.</div>

No... :(.  It only works with gnome desktop. Kubuntu uses KDE.</div>

During Diwali vacations, I learnt python language by reading "Python Programming: Introduction to Computer Science" by      John M.Zelle, Ph.D, Its well written book with some nice examples which tries to explore power of python.<br />So I decided to write some useful programs in python. I found one interesting open source project from Nokia, Py60. through which you can write python programs for your mobile.<br /><br />Nokia has done great job by introducing <a href="http://wiki.opensource.nokia.com/projects/PyS60">py60.</a>  <blockquote>   <span style="font-style: italic;">"Python for S60 is Nokia's port of the </span><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://python.org/" class="external text" title="http://python.org/" rel="nofollow">Python</a><span style="font-style: italic;"> language to the </span><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://s60.com/" class="external text" title="http://s60.com/" rel="nofollow">S60</a> smartphone platform. In addition to the standard features of the Python language, PyS60 provides access to many of the phone's uniquely smartphone-y functions, such as camera, contacts, calendar, audio recording and playing, TCP/IP and Bluetooth communications and simple telephony."<blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>  You can use emulator or your mobile phone (S60 platform) to run/test python programs. I use my Nokia N70 to run python and so far it's great fun! You can write the program in your computer and transfer it to your mobile phone. There is an interactive console in the mobile phone so that you can write your program directly in the mobile phone. There is another blue-tooth based console which I haven't tried yet (my bluetooth dongle is not working, I might have reached its data transfer limit :) ).<br /><br />Currently I am working on a project which will be used find cell phone location based on GSM information provided by service provider.<br />This project will leverage scripts provided <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nokia-gsm-location-hacks/">Nokia GSM location hacks</a>, to geocode  phone location.<br />Usabilty of this application will be to find nearest useful utilities based on your location. Imagine your are in unknown city and you run out of money  and you don't know where is the nearest ATM, this project might help you.<br />Bye for now, will update you on status of project on next week.<br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote></blockquote></div>
