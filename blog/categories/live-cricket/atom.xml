    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During last cricket world cup, I developed cricket score android application named as cricscoredroid. I had taken this application off from android market for 6 months now as there was not free score provider was available after world cup.</p>

<p> Cricscoredroid was very popular during cricket world cup, it had 4.5 rating in android market and was installed by more than 25k users within 2 months of its release. Reason of its popularity was its very simple and fastest in android market. Also it has some unique notification features.</p>

<p> Cricscoredroid is back in Google Play now with lots UI improvements. Cricscoredroid now features Android HOLO dark theme and Honeycomb styled Action Bar using <a href="http://www.holoeverywhere.com/">HoloEverywhere</a>  and <a href="http://actionbarsherlock.com/">ActionBarSherlock</a> . What this library does is that if youâ€™re using your app in a device with Android 2.x, it gives you an ActionBar that is a copy of the real Honeycomb ActionBar, thanks to <a href="http://jakewharton.com/">Jake Wharton</a> , a guy who created this library.</p>

<p> It is available on  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samarth.cricscorereturn">Google Play</a> .
Use and rate it on google play!. Screenshots of cricscoredroid with new Holo Dark theme,</p>
