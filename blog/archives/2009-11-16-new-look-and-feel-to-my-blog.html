Y'day night,I changed the whole look and feel of this blog. Isn't it cool?<br /><br /> I managed to add header image following this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUIdl1xC5eA">video</a> and header image is captured somewhere near to GOA by one my team mate during our last trip.<br />  I edited this image to fit to header size size i.e. 1230 px X 250 px by using <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">gimp</a>. Its really powerful tool to manipulate image.<br /><br /> and background colour is changed by applying my html skills. I picked colour from header image using gimp and edited blog html (Dashboard->Layout->Edit HTML) to add this background colour to body, sidebar and header itself.<br /><br /> Finally I managed to give this nice and cool look and feel to my blog.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3378664837135510220-1338559783864805634?l=www.blog.sachinpatil.com' alt='' /></div>
