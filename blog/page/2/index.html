Its been just three months, I learnt <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> (or I started learning it as there many more aspects to learn) and  I am already very fond of it. Especially I have started using python for scripting work. I automated few things using python scripts which I had to do regularly like a creating users in oracle, copying / importing oracle dumps, syncing Wiki svn log with svn sever and many more. <br />  Some might argue that you can do the same thing in shell scripts or other programming languages. You can do that  but coding in python is 5-10 times faster and <a href="http://pythonconquerstheuniverse.wordpress.com/category/java-and-python/">this article</a> gives insight comparative of Java with python.<br />  To create connection in Java, it involves three steps but with python its just one step<br /><pre name="code" class="py"><br />    conn = cx_Oracle.connect(username, password, sid)<br /></pre><br />  <br />  I am not bad-mouthing Java here. With <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/">JEE6</a> at doorstep, Java has progressed very well as web technologies. <br />  For now, I will be using python for writing utility scripts unless I get chance to work on real big python Project.<br />  As experienced Java programmers, I found this <a href="http://python.computersci.org/">e-book</a> very helpful for learning python <br />  Coding in python as easy as in Java, I have already written <a href="http://cricscoreapplet.sourceforge.net/">cricket live score</a> gnome applet in python which been huge success.<br /><br /> Being interpreted language Python is little bit slow. With the Java just-in-time compiler, Java is faster.</div>

The Ubuntu 10.04 release is near. Recently the Ubuntu 10.04 final version was made avaialble to testers for testing.It is also known as Lucid Lynx. This technology supports kernel mode-setting for Linux kernel image boot more fluid between the boot and start X server. I am a Linux- Ubuntu user and I am very much eager to get the Ubuntu 10.04. I got the information about this from:<br />http://www.techarena.in/news/27123-ubuntu-1004-lucid-lynx-made-available-testers.htm</div>

In fact in its just 2nd day after 1.0-alpha release of <a href="http://cricscoreapplet.sourceforge.net/">CricScore Gnome applet</a>, It has netted more than 100 downloads. Now this is a terrific figure by all means since I wrote this as utility for personal use as fun, I was not expecting it could be a professional gnome applet.<br />  I just shared this across few Linux related forums on orkut, ubuntu communities and got such huge reply. It feel good factor to me.<br />There has been very positive reply so far like this,<br /><br /> <blockquote>&#8220;Great applet! I&#8217;ve been looking for something like this. Just what I needed!&#8221;, says Jorgo <br />  upengan78 is running it on &#8220;gentoo&#8221;, he comments, &#8220;It is working as intended. Many thanks for such a nice applet. Good luck for more such applets&#8221;<br />  Ankur suggested me to make it official package, &#8220;Cann&#8217;t we have your applet from official repositories ???&#8221;<br />  Kamalakar says &#8220;I am using it today for India Sri Lanka score. Good to have it on Gnome top panel.&#8221;   <br />   </blockquote><br />There has been few feature requests also and few wanted to have one smiler applet for Football/Socker. I have already implemented few features in latest 1.0 release.  <br />  There are few people interested to work with me in writing an applet for Football, hopefully I will have it defiantly before FIFA2010. <br /><blockquote> Arun S.A.G wants to package this applet for Fedora, &#8220;I would like to package your applet for Fedora, i have tested it in Fedora 12 it works fine :-)&#8221;.</blockquote><br />  Thanks guys for such motivation and feedbacks.  <br /> Today I released <a href="http://cricscoreapplet.sourceforge.net/">1.0 release</a>, I did not do any code changes, as it did not require, alpha release worked like charm, but I added READEME, INSTALL, COPYRIGHT file as this applet is no more personal :).<br /><br />  There are many feature requests pending on my plate. I will try to work on those in spare time.<br /><br />   Possibilities Are Endless!!!</div>

As huge cricket fan, I wanted to have easy access to cricket scores, right at gnome-panel on Ubuntu OS, the way I see date/time. I searched for it on Internet but could not find. So I decided to write my own a gnome-applet which will show latest score at gnome-panel.<br />  I modified this <a href="http://blog.kevinmehall.net/2009/python-gnome-panel-applet">applet</a> to show cricket score. Originally it was meant to show battery power.<br />  Cricket score applet is written in python using <a href="http://www.sachystechnoworld.co.cc/2009/10/python.html">my latest python skills</a> which makes use of <a href="http://livechat.rediff.com/sports/score/score.txt">rediff scores</a> as source.<br /><br />Screenshot: <br /> <br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_A2_wLwXdBek/Sw5brJ3YVUI/AAAAAAAACtM/Cnwf_6WgMYA/s1600/cricscore.jpg"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 84px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_A2_wLwXdBek/Sw5brJ3YVUI/AAAAAAAACtM/Cnwf_6WgMYA/s320/cricscore.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5408360999459247426" /></a><br /><br /><br />This applet can be downloaded from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/cricscoreapplet/">here</a>. It contains install.sh script copies the files to the necessary locations to make it show up in the applets list. You have to restart gnome display manager either by re-logging in or with this command:<br /><pre name="code" class="cpp"><br />sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart<br /></pre><br />  <br />This is my first contribution to wonderful Linux world, hence you might find bugs. Please feel free to contact me @ sachin6870@gmail.com.<br /><br />  Enjoy!!!<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"> [Update]</span>: Few of interesting user requested me to put details step how to install this utility, here you go:<br />  <br />Download cricscore.tar.gz and navigate to that folder and run following commands, (in my case the folder &#8220;~/downloads&#8221;) and run following commands,<br /><br /><pre name="code" class="cpp"><br />sachin@sachin-laptop:~/downloads$ tar xzf cricscore.tar.gz<br />sachin@sachin-laptop:~/downloads$ cd cricscore/<br />sachin@sachin-laptop:~/downloads/cricscore$ ls<br />cricketscore.py cricketscore.server install.sh<br />sachin@sachin-laptop:~/downloads/cricscore$ sudo ./install.sh<br />[sudo] password for sachin:<br /></pre><br /> This step will logout, make sure you save all your work.<br /><pre name="code" class="cpp"><br />sachin@sachin-laptop:~/downloads/cricscore$ sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart<br /></pre><br /> <br /> After re-login, Right click in an empty space on your gnome panel and select Add to Panel from the menu that appears. A small window pops open, which displays the panel applets that are installed. Find &#8220;Cricket Score Applet&#8221; in the list, click Add, and then click Close. A new icon appears on the panel.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">[update]</span>  hosted this utility at <a href="http://cricscoreapplet.sourceforge.net/">sourceforge</a></div>

There is no &quot;best desktop&quot;, but there is a desktop that&#39;s best for you. It&#39;s a matter of preference.<br /><br />I used KDE for a year, specially for Amarok.  But then switched to Gnome http://www.sachystechnoworld.co.cc/2009/10/themes-for-gnome-ubuntu.html.<br /> I feel gnome has much professional look and feel, KDE is good for who has switched from Windows recently.</div>

Are you wondering about what will happen to your email/chat accounts once you die? <br /><br />  Well, I remember if you don&#8217;t use your account for some period of time or so, then provider terminates it, and, in fact, having asked around all the majors - Gmail, Yahoo Mail, Hotmail and Twitter, that does seem to be largely the case. Here&#8217;s how it runs.,<br /><br />Gmail<br /><br />Google will terminate your account in accordance with the terms of service if you fail to login to your account for a period of nine months is the phrase I was looking for along with the fact that people can actively delete their accounts.<br /><br />Yahoo! Mail<br /><br />Yahoo! was also most accommodating. The answer was very different though. It seems, with their service, that once your name has gone, it&#8217;s gone forever. As it stands, inactive accounts are not terminated and will lie idle indefinitely.<br /><br /><br />Twitter<br /><br />Accounts that are inactive for more than 6 months may be removed without further notice.</div>

This is very very older to android. Checkout <a href="http://maemo.org/.">Maemo</a>.<br /> It may not even get launched in India. Nokia has stated &#8220;selected markets&#8221; in their press release. No tablet has been officially released by them in the past also here, which is bad news for Indian linux fans</div>

After upgrade to Ubuntu Karmic, mouse clicks stopped in <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">eclipse</a>, my favourite IDE, mainly for submit buttons. Until today I used keyboard as alternative, but it was bit frustrating. <br /><br />  This issue raised because karmic brings version 2.18 of GTK+ to the desktop. GTK+ is a multi-platform toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces. Offering a complete set of widgets, the GTK+ is suitable for projects ranging from small one-off tools to complete application suites.<br /><br />Eclipse assume that they can just operate on the X windows corresponding to their GDK windows without ever telling GDK, which causes some widgets to exhibit weird behaviour. <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=287307">Bug 287307</a> was filed with the Eclipse foundation and this is fixed for the upcoming 3.6 release.<br /><br />Fortunately, the GTK+ people provide a switch to turn off the client side windows. So to work around the bug with Eclipse pre-3.6, just make sure you set environment variable GDK_NATIVE_WINDOWS=1  <br /> I created simple eclipse launcher script which will set this variable.<br /><br /><pre name="code" class="cpp"><br />#!/bin/sh<br />export GDK_NATIVE_WINDOWS=1<br />/home/sachin/opt/eclipse3.5/eclipse<br /><br /></pre><br /><br />and added it to /usr/bin.<br /><br />  Happy coding!!!</div>
