In fact in its just 2nd day after 1.0-alpha release of <a href="http://cricscoreapplet.sourceforge.net/">CricScore Gnome applet</a>, It has netted more than 100 downloads. Now this is a terrific figure by all means since I wrote this as utility for personal use as fun, I was not expecting it could be a professional gnome applet.<br />  I just shared this across few Linux related forums on orkut, ubuntu communities and got such huge reply. It feel good factor to me.<br />There has been very positive reply so far like this,<br /><br /> <blockquote>"Great applet! I've been looking for something like this. Just what I needed!", says Jorgo <br />  upengan78 is running it on "gentoo", he comments, "It is working as intended. Many thanks for such a nice applet. Good luck for more such applets"<br />  Ankur suggested me to make it official package, "Cann't we have your applet from official repositories ???"<br />  Kamalakar says "I am using it today for India Sri Lanka score. Good to have it on Gnome top panel."   <br />   </blockquote><br />There has been few feature requests also and few wanted to have one smiler applet for Football/Socker. I have already implemented few features in latest 1.0 release.  <br />  There are few people interested to work with me in writing an applet for Football, hopefully I will have it defiantly before FIFA2010. <br /><blockquote> Arun S.A.G wants to package this applet for Fedora, "I would like to package your applet for Fedora, i have tested it in Fedora 12 it works fine :-)".</blockquote><br />  Thanks guys for such motivation and feedbacks.  <br /> Today I released <a href="http://cricscoreapplet.sourceforge.net/">1.0 release</a>, I did not do any code changes, as it did not require, alpha release worked like charm, but I added READEME, INSTALL, COPYRIGHT file as this applet is no more personal :).<br /><br />  There are many feature requests pending on my plate. I will try to work on those in spare time.<br /><br />   Possibilities Are Endless!!!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3378664837135510220-2679330560475070335?l=www.blog.sachinpatil.com' alt='' /></div>
