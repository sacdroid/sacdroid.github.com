As huge cricket fan, I wanted to have easy access to cricket scores, right at gnome-panel on Ubuntu OS, the way I see date/time. I searched for it on Internet but could not find. So I decided to write my own a gnome-applet which will show latest score at gnome-panel.<br />  I modified this <a href="http://blog.kevinmehall.net/2009/python-gnome-panel-applet">applet</a> to show cricket score. Originally it was meant to show battery power.<br />  Cricket score applet is written in python using <a href="http://www.sachystechnoworld.co.cc/2009/10/python.html">my latest python skills</a> which makes use of <a href="http://livechat.rediff.com/sports/score/score.txt">rediff scores</a> as source.<br /><br />Screenshot: <br /> <br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_A2_wLwXdBek/Sw5brJ3YVUI/AAAAAAAACtM/Cnwf_6WgMYA/s1600/cricscore.jpg"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 84px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_A2_wLwXdBek/Sw5brJ3YVUI/AAAAAAAACtM/Cnwf_6WgMYA/s320/cricscore.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5408360999459247426" /></a><br /><br /><br />This applet can be downloaded from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/cricscoreapplet/">here</a>. It contains install.sh script copies the files to the necessary locations to make it show up in the applets list. You have to restart gnome display manager either by re-logging in or with this command:<br /><pre name="code" class="cpp"><br />sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart<br /></pre><br />  <br />This is my first contribution to wonderful Linux world, hence you might find bugs.
